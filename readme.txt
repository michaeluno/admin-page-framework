Provides simpler means of building administration pages for plugin and theme developers. 

== Description ==
It provides plugin and theme developers with easier means of creating option pages. Extend the library class and pass your arrays that define the form elements to the predefined class methods. The library handles all the complex coding behind the scene and creates the pages and the forms for you. The package includes a demo plugin which helps you walk through necessary features.

**Notes:** this framework does not do anything by itself. If you are not a developer, you do not need this.

= Features =
- **Root Page, Sub Pages, and Tabs** - allows you to instantly create a top level page and the sub pages of it, plus tabs inside the sub pages.
- **Custom Post Types** - helps to create custom post types and insert custom columns in the post listing table.
- **Meta Boxes** - helps to create custom meta boxes with form fields, that means it enables to store additinal data associated with a post that your users create. 
- **Widgets** - helps to create widgets with the form fields that the framework provides. 
- **Network Admin Pages** - network admin pages for WordPress multi-sites can be created.
- **Extensible** - the created admin pages will become highly extensible with the automatically created hooks. In other words, it empowers other developers to customize your plugin or theme. That will result on making your projects grow.
- **Section Tabs** - form sections can be displayed in a tabbed box.
- **Repeatability** - supports repeatable form sections and fields which means the user can dynamically add/remove form fields.
- **Sotability** - supports sortable form fields which means the user can set the order of fields by moving the field with drag-and-drop.
- **Import and Export Options** - buttons that the user can import and export settings by uploading and downloading text files.
- **Reset Button** - lets the user to initialize the saved options.
- **Validation and Error Messages** - with the pre-defined validation callbacks, the user's submitting form data can be verified. Furthermore, by setting the error array, you can display the error message to the user.
- **Taxonomy Fields** - the framework provides methods to add fields in the taxonomy definition page.
- **Contextual Help Pane** - help contents can be added to the contextual help pane that appears at the top right of each screen.
- **Custom Field Types** - your own field type can be registered. This allows you to design own fields such as a combination of a checkbox with a text field. 

= Built-in Field Types =
- `text` - a normal field to enter text input.
- `password` - a masked text input field.
- `textarea` - a text input field with multiple lines. It supports TinyMCE rich text editor.
- `radio` - a set of radio buttons that lets the user pick an option.
- `checkbox` - a check box that lets the user enable/disable an item.
- `select` - a drop-down list that lest the user pick one or more item(s) from a list.
- `hidden` - a hidden field that will be useful to insert invisible values.
- `file` - a file uploader that lets the user upload files.
- `image` - a custom text field with the image uploader script that lets the user set an image URL.
- `media` - a custom text field with the media uploader script that lets the user set a file URL.
- `color` - a custom text field with the color picker script.
- `submit` - a submit button that lets the user send the form.
- `export` - a custom submit field that lets the user export the stored data.
- `import` - a custom combination field of the file and the submit fields that let the user import data.
- `posttype` - a set of check-lists of taxonomies enabled on the site in a tabbed box.
- `taxonomy` - check-lists of taxonomies enabled on the site in a tabbed box.
- `size` - a combination field of the text and the select fields that let the user set sizes with a selectable unit.
- `section_title` - a text field type that will be placed in the section title so that it lets the user set the section title.

= Custom Field Types = 
You can include your own custom field types when they are necessary. The reason that they are not built-in is to keep the library size as small as possible. The example custom field types are included in the demo plugin.

- `geometry` - a location selector with the Google map.
- `date`, `time`, `date_time`, `date_range`, `time_range`, `date_time_range` - date and time fields with the date picker.
- `dial` - a dial input field.
- `font` - a font uploader and its preview.
- `revealer` - a selector field that displays a hidden HTML element.
- `grid` - a drag and drop grid composer.
- `autocomplete` - a custom text field that shows a predefined pop-up autocomplete list.
- `link` - it lets pick a post and set the url.
- `system` - displays the site system information.
- `github` - displays GitHub buttons.

= Necessary Files =
- **`admin-page-framework.min.php`** is in the *library* folder. Alternatively you may use **`admin-page-framework.php`** located in the *development* folder. In that case, all the class files in the sub-folders need to be copied.

= Documentation =
The HTML documentation is included in the distribution package and can be accessed via the sidebar menu that the demo plugin creates.

== Installation ==

= Getting Started =

<h5><strong>Step 1</strong> - Include <em><strong>admin-page-framework.min.php</strong></em></h5>
You need to include the library file in your PHP script. The file is located in the `library` folder of the uncompressed plugin file.

`
if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework.min.php' );
}
`
    
<h5><strong>Step 2</strong> - Extend the Library Class</h5>

`
class APF_GettingStarted extends AdminPageFramework {
}
`

<h5><strong>Step 3</strong> - Define the <em>setUp()</em> Method</h5>

`
public function setUp() {
    $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );    // specifies to which parent menu to belong.
    $this->addSubMenuItem(
        array(
            'title'     => 'My First Page',
            'page_slug' => 'myfirstpage',
        )
    ); 
}
`

<h5><strong>Step 4</strong> - Define the Methods for Hooks</h5>

`
public function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_{page slug}    
    ?>
    <h3>Say Something</h3>
    <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
    <?php
}
`

<h5><strong>Step 5</strong> - Instantiate the Class</h5>

`
new APF;
`

<h5><strong>Example Code</strong> - Getting Started</h5>

`
<?php
/* Plugin Name: Admin Page Framework - Getting Started */ 

if ( ! class_exists( 'AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    include_once( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework.min.php' );
}
    
class APF extends AdminPageFramework {

    public function setUp() {
        
        $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' );    // where to belong
        $this->addSubMenuItem(
            array(
                'title'     => 'My First Page',
                'page_slug' => 'myfirstpage'
            )
        );
            
    }

    public function do_myfirstpage() {  // do_{page slug}
        ?>
        <h3>Say Something</h3>
        <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
        <?php   
    }
    
}

== Frequently asked questions ==

<h4>About the Project</h4>
<h5><strong>What is this for?</strong></h5>
This is a PHP class library that helps to create option pages and form fields in the administration panel. In addition, it helps to manage to save, export, and import options.

<h5><strong>I've written a useful class, functions, and even custom field types that will be useful for others! Do you want to include it?</strong></h5>
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework "Admin Page Framework") is available. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues) first and we'll see if changes can be made. 

<h5><strong>How can I contribute to improving the documentation?</strong></h5>
You are welcome to submit documentation. Please follow the [Documentation Guideline](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/blob/master/documentation_guideline.md). 

In addition, your tutorials and snippets for the framework can be listed in the manual. Let us know it [here](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues?direction=desc&labels=Documentation&page=1&sort=created&state=open).

<h5><strong>Does my commercial product incorporating your framework library have to be released under GPL2v+?</strong></h5>
No. The demo plugin is released under GPLv2 or later but the library itself is released under MIT. Make sure to include only the library file.

<h5><strong>Does the framework work with WordPress Multi-site?</strong></h5>
Yes, it works with [WordPress MU](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_MU).

<h4>Technical Questions</h4>
<h5><strong>Can I set a custom post type as a root page?</strong></h5>
Yes. For built-in root menu items or create your own ones, you need to use the `setRootMenuPage()` method. For root pages of custom post types, use `setRootMenuPageBySlug()`.

`$this->setRootMenuPageBySlug( 'edit.php?post_type=apf_posts' );    `

<h5><strong>How do I retrieve the stored options?</strong></h5>
The framework stores them as an organized multidimensional array in the options table in a single row. So use the `get_option()` function and pass the instantiated class name as the key or the custom key if you specify one in the constructor. 

For instance, if your instantiated class name is `APF` then the code would be 

`
$my_options = get_option( 'APF' );
` 

Alternatively, use the [AdminPageFramework::getOption()](http://admin-page-framework.michaeluno.jp/en/v3/class-AdminPageFramework.html#_getOption) static method.

<h5><strong>Is it possible to use a custom options data for the form instead of the ones used by the framework?</strong></h5>
Yes, there are two main means to achieve that. 

1. Use the `value` argument in the field definition array to suppress the displaying value in the field.
See an example. https://gist.github.com/michaeluno/fb4088b922b71710c7fb

2. Override the options array set to the entire form using the `options_{instantiated class name}`.
See an example. https://gist.github.com/michaeluno/fcfac27825aa8a35b90f

When you go with the second method, make sure to pass an empty string, `''` to the first parameter of the constructor so that it disables the ability to store submitted form data into the options table.

`
new MyAdminPage( '' );
`

<h5><strong>How can I add sub-menu pages to the top-level page created by the framework in a separate script?</strong></h5>

Say, in your main plugin, your class `MyAdminPageClassA` created a top-level page. In your extension plugin, you want to add sub-menu pages from another instance `MyAdminPageClassB`. 

In the `setUp()` method of `MyAdminPageClasB`, pass the instantiated class name of the main plugin that created the root menu, `MyAdminPageClassA`, to the `setRootMenuPageBySlug()` method.

`
$this->setRootMenuPageBySlug( 'MyAdminPageClassA' );
`

<h5><strong>Can I create pages in the network admin area?</strong></h5>
Yes, See the demo.

<h4>More FAQ Items</h4>
Check out the [questions tagged as FAQ](https://github.com/michaeluno/admin-page-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AFAQ) on GitHub.

== Other Notes ==

<h4>Use Unique Page Slug</h4>
The framework internally uses the `add_submenu_page()` function to register sub menu pages. When the same page slug is registered for multiple root pages, only the last registered callback gets triggered. The other ones will be ignored.

This means if you choose a very simple page slug such as <code>about</code> for your plugin/theme's information page and then if there is another plugin using the same page slug, your users will get either of your page or the other.

To avoid this, make sure to use a unique page slug. One way to do that is to add a prefix like <code>apf_about</code>. 

<h4>Change PHP Class Names</h4>
When you include the framework, change the class names that the framework uses. This is because if there is a plugin that uses a lesser version of the framework and it is loaded earlier than yours, your script may not work properly.

All the class names have the prefix <code>AdminPageFramework</code> so just change it to something like <code>MyPlugin_AdminPageFramework</code>. 

Most text editors supports the *Replace All* command so just use that. By the time WordPress's minimum required PHP version becomes 5.3 or higher, we can use namespaces then this problem will be solved.

<h4>Change Framework's System Messages</h4>
The default messages defined by the framework can be changed. For example, when you import a setting with the framework, the setting notice "The options have been updated." will be displayed. 

If you want to change it to something else, modify the `oMsg` object. It has the `aMessages` public property array holding all the messages that the framework uses.

<h4>Get comfortable with the 'attributes' array argument</h4>
In each field definition array, you can set the `attributes` arguments which defines the HTML attributes of the field so that you can modify the output of the field by passing attribute values.

The argument accepts the values as an array. Each element represents the attribute's name and value. The array key corresponds to the name of the attribute and the value to the attribute value.

For example,
`
array(    
    'field_id'      => 'interval',
    'title'         => __( 'Interval', 'task-scheduler' ),
    'type'          => 'number',
    'attributes'    => array(
        'min'   => 0,
        'step'  => 1,
        'max'   => 24,
    ),
),
`

In addition, you can change the attributes of the following container elements by setting their key and passing a nested attribute array.

- `fieldrow` - the `td` tag element containing the field output.
- `fieldset` - the `fieldset` tag element containing the field output.
- `fields` - the `div` tag element containing the sub-fields and the main field.
- `field` - the `div` tag element containing each field.

This submit button will float on the right.
`
array(    
    'field_id'          => 'submit',
    'type'              => 'submit',
    'label'             => __( 'Save', 'task-scheduler' ),
    'label_min_width'   => 0,
    'attributes'        => array(
        'field' => array(
            'style' => 'float:right; clear:none; display: inline;',
        ),
    ),                    
)    
`

<h4>Change Preview Image Size of the 'image' Field Type</h4>
To specify a custom size to the preview element of the `image` field type, set an attribute array like the below, where 300px is the max width.

`array(
    'field_id'      => 'my_image_field_id',
    'title'         => __( 'Image', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
    'type'          => 'image',
    'attributes'    => array(
        'style' => 'max-width:300px;',
    ),
),`

<h4>Display items of 'radio' field type one per line</h4>
To display radio button items one per line, set the `label_min_width` to `100%`.

`array(
    'field_id'          => 'my_radio_field_id',
    'title'             => __( 'Radio Button', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
    'type'              => 'radio',
    'label_min_width'   => '100%',
    'label'             => array(
        'a' => __( 'This is a.', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
        'b' => __( 'This is b.', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
        'c' => __( 'This is a.', 'admin-page-framework-demo' )c
    ),
),`

<h4>Set default field value</h4>
To set the initial value of a field, use the `default` argument in the field definition array.

`array(
    'field_id'  => 'my_text_field_id',
    'title'     => __( 'My Text Input Field', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
    'type'      => 'text',
    'default'   => 'This text will be displayed for the first time that the field is displayed and will be overridden when a user set an own value.',
),`

<h4>Always display a particular value in a field</h4>
The `value` argument in the definition array can suppress the saved value. This is useful when you want to set a value from a different data source or create a wizard form that stores the data in a custom location.

`array(
    'field_id'  => 'my_text_field_id',
    'title'     => __( 'My Text Input Field', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
    'type'      => 'text',
    'value'     => 'This will be always set.',
),`

If it is a repeatable field, set the value in the sub-fields.

`array(
    'field_id'      => 'my_text_field_id',
    'title'         => __( 'My Text Input Field', 'admin-page-framework-demo' ),
    'type'          => 'text',
    'repeatable'    => true,
    'value'         => 'the first value',
    array(
        'value' => 'the second value',
    ),
    array(
        'value' => 'the third value',
    ),    
),`

Alternately, if it is in a framework's generic pages (not post meta box fields) you may use the `options_{instantiated class name}` filter to suppress the options so that setting the value argument is not necessary.
