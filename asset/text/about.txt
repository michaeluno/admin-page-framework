== New Features ==
<h3>Nested Sections</h3>

Finally, we can nest form sections. This allows you to construct complex forms with combinations of sections such as collapsible sections inside tabbed sections.

<h3>Pointer Tool Tips</h3>

With the newly introduced class, `AdminPageFramework_PointerToolTip`, you can now easily show small instructions to your users by adding a pointer tool tip which pops up in your desired screen at the targeted element. It will not be displayed once the user dismisses it.

== Getting Started ==

![My First Page](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/getting_started/my_first_page.png "My First Page")

<h3>Write Your First Plugin</h3>
Let's create a very simple plugin to understand the whole workflow of using Admin Page Framework.

<h3>Step 1 - Get the Files</h3>

![Component Generator](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/getting_started/my_first_plugin.png "Component Generator")

First, you need to have your own copy of the framework files. 

1. Go to **Dashboard** -> **Admin Page Framework** -> **Tools** -> **[Generator](%WP_ADMIN_URL%/admin.php?page=apfl_tools)**.
2. **(Important!)** Enter your unique prefix. If your plugin is named, let's say "My First Plugin" then you may set the prefix "`MyFirstPlugin_`".
3. Also set the text domain of your project, `my-first-plugin` as an example. This will be used when creating translation files.
4. Download the file by pressing **Download**.
5. If download is successful, you'll get a zip file named `{your text domain-}admin-page-framework.zip`. Extract the contents to your preferred location at your convenience. 
Make sure `admin-page-framework.php`, `admin-page-framework-include-class-list.php` and some other sub-directories are present in the extracted directory.

<h3>Step 2 - Include the Framework</h3>

Now it is time to code. In your code editor, insert your plugin header comment to tell WordPress that it is a plugin.

`
/* Plugin Name: My Plugin */
`

Next, you need to tell PHP to include the framework you just downloaded. The file name to include is `admin-page-framework.php`, the bootstrap script of the framework.

Assuming your class prefix set in the above step is `MyFirstPlugin_`, then your factory class name to extend will be `MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework`. If you have not set the prefix, it will be just `AdminPageFramework`.

So check if that class name has been already loaded. And if not, load it. To load a PHP file, you can use the `include()` PHP function and pass the framework path to it (set your own path there).

`
include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework/admin-page-framework.php' );
if ( ! class_exists( 'MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    return;
}
`

<h3>Step 3 - Extend the Factory Class</h3>
By extending the framework admin factory class, you can add your own desired functionality on top of it.

`
class MyFirstPlugin extends MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework {

  ... our code comes here ...
   
}
`

<h3>Step 4 - Define the <em>setUp()</em> Method</h3>
Now we need to tell the framework what page to create. 
The factory class already defines certain methods. If you extend the class, your extended class already has those methods.
The `setUp()` method is one of them, and in this method, you set up necessary configurations.

The `setRootMenuPage()` method allows you to set the top-level page and the `addSubMenuItem()` method allows you to add sub-menu pages and links.

Let's add a page to the `Settings` page. You need to decide what pag slug to use. Pick a unique one. Here we use `my_first_page` as an example.

`
public function setUp() {
    $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' ); 
    $this->addSubMenuItem(
        array(
            'title'     => 'My First Page',
            'page_slug' => 'my_first_page',
        )
    ); 
}
`

<h3>Step 5 - Define the Methods for Hooks</h3>
Now you can insert your own output of the page with some of the pre-defined callback methods.

One of them is `do_{page slug}` method. You define a method named like so and it will be automatically gets called.

`
public function do_my_first_page() {
    ?>
    <h3>Say Something</h3>
    <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
    <?php
}
`

<h3>Step 6 - Instantiate the Class</h3>
You need to instantiate the class you defined. When it is instantiated, it will run the internal constructor and takes care of everything needed to create admin pages for you.

`
new MyFirstPlugin;
`

![Plugin Listed](%PLUGIN_DIR_URL%/asset/image/getting_started/my_first_plugin_in_plugin_list_table.png "Plugin Listed")

And your code is now ready to run as a plugin. Compress it in a zip file and upload it to your WordPres site.

<h3>Example Plugin</h3>
**[Download](https://github.com/michaeluno/my-first-plugin/archive/master.zip)**
`
<?php
/* Plugin Name: My First Plugin */ 

// Set your own path here
include( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/library/admin-page-framework/admin-page-framework.php' );
if ( ! class_exists( 'MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework' ) ) {
    return;
}

class MyFirstPlugin extends MyFirstPlugin_AdminPageFramework {
    
    /**
     * Sets up pages. 
     */
    public function setUp() {
        $this->setRootMenuPage( 'Settings' ); 
        $this->addSubMenuItem(
            array(
                'title'     => 'My First Page',
                'page_slug' => 'my_first_page'
            )
        );
    }
    
    /**
     * Triggered in the middle of rendering the page.
     * 
     * Inserts your custom contents here.
     * 
     * @remark      do_{page slug}
     */
    public function do_my_first_page() {
        ?>
        <h3>Say Something</h3>
        <p>This is my first admin page!</p>
        <?php   
    }

}

new MyFirstPlugin;
`

See it's very short and simple, huh?

There are different types of factory classes for different functionality besides the admin page factory class you just used.

By extending them like just you did, you can create post types, meta boxes, widgets, user meta fields, and taxonomy fields.
